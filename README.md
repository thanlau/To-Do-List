# To-Do-List
We use SQLite to create the database and SQLAlchemy to manage the database from Python.The to-do-list support:
Today's tasks. Prints all tasks for today.
Add task. Asks for task description and saves it in the database.
Missed tasks: prints all tasks whose deadline was missed, that is, tasks whose deadline date is earlier than today's date.
Delete task: deletes the chosen task. Print 'Nothing to delete' if the tasks list is empty.
Week's tasks: prints all tasks for 7 days from today.
All tasks: prints all tasks sorted by deadline.
